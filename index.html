        <p class="lead mb-4">My favorite thing in the world is basketball. I would take any of my leisure time that is available for playing basketball. I still remembered the first time I visited Staples Center, it was three years ago and I decided to watch a Laker's game, I forgot about who is the opponent but I remembered that the ticket is like 300 bucks, a seat at the left side of the court which was seated at section 116. When I arrived at the front door of the Staples Center, the crowd have already occupied the outside, people wearing Lakersâ€™ sport shirt walking around, and my excitement arose with the floods. Actually, it took us quite some time to drive there because the traffic was jammed, most of the cars were aim to watch the game just like us. The parking fee is 25 dollars and the parking lot is full of cars already, of course, we took the lesson and the next time we took an hour before to avoid the traffic problem. When we got into the door, the security check is pretty strict and after we got in, there is a restaurant and many people were having a meal there. I didn't experience the food there but the next several time we go there we got some snacks and beer, there are many diners inside the Center incorporate all kinds of snacks, drinks, and beer, I like the taco next to section 117, it is delicious. And much other fast food and fine diner that we did not experience yet, maybe in the future. The most imperative store is Team LA, there are officially licensed merchandise featuring all players and teams of the NBA, NHL, and MLS, I went to the Lakers' that's for sure and bought a Kobe's shirt which cost me 100 bucks. This is the most exciting place because everyone seems to wear Laker's clothes and everyone looked exciting and aroused. There were so many merchandises that worth buying, hence every one of us bought something. The reason why I could remember these things so well in details is that such an experience enhances my love for basketball and this valuable memory would never fade.<br><br>
